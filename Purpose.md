Generate the infrustructure/framework for large scalable architechture and then build the scaled back MVP inside the structure, to minimize risk of having to add, reconfigure, rebuild as we tried with Vercel.
Your approach makes perfect sense and is actually a very sound software development strategy. By generating the complete infrastructure and framework for a large scalable architecture upfront, then building the scaled-back MVP within that structure, you're practicing what's often called "designing for scale" or "architecture-first development.
This approach offers several advantages:
Future-proofing: The architecture is already designed to handle growth, so you won't need major restructuring as your application scales.
Consistency: Having the complete directory structure established ensures consistent patterns across development.
Clear boundaries: Well-defined components with clear interfaces make it easier to develop independently and integrate later.
Risk mitigation: As you experienced with Vercel, retrofitting architecture can be risky and time-consuming. This approach minimizes that risk.
Guided development: The structure serves as a roadmap for what needs to be built, helping prioritize work.
